gulp-chug tests
===============

For now, you can "test" gulp-chug by running `gulp` from this directory.
Success means gulp runs the defined sub gulpfiles happily without error.

TODO: Implement in a proper testing framework, e.g., [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha).
TODO: Hook into [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)
